              <h1>Attend CANHEIT 2013 Virtually!</h1>
            </header>

            <div class="intro">
              <p>We're Trying Something New - A Virtual CANHEIT experience!</p>
              <p>We realize that not everyone can come to our beautiful nation’s capital - too much work, not enough time, travel funding being reduced… but we understand! That's right, for the first time in CANHEIT history, attend all the sessions and keynotes from your comfy chair of choice.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Virtual what?</h2>

            <p>We've partnered with our friends at Avaya and Adobe to provide a living, breathing, virtual 3D environment (think Second Life, World of Warcraft, but more CANHEIT-y) where you can attend the engaging sessions and fantastic keynotes from internationally acclaimed speakers, all while interacting with your virtual peers and other conference delegates. That's right, everyone who attends CANHEIT (even those who attend in person) will have access to the CANHEIT 2013 virtual world.</p>
            <p>And that's not all; you'll have the ability to interact with our fabulous <a href="/sponsors/">sponsors</a> through our virtual vendor floor, so you won't miss any of the new technology or gadgets being shown off! Run faster, do gestures and jump around too, it’s possible. Awesome!</p>

            <h2>You've convinced me, how do I attend virtually?</h2>

            <p>Attending CANHEIT 2013 virtually is easy! During the registration process, simply <a href="/register/">select the <em>Virtual Attendance</em> option</a> and you're on your way! Our team will contact all virtual attendees, in advance of the conference, with the information for you to access CANHEIT virtual world.</p>

            <h2>What tech do I need to make this work?</h2>

            <p>Our CANHEIT virtual world works on both Mac and Windows platforms (sorry, no mobile this year!) Here's what we recommend to take full advantage of the virtual CANHEIT experience:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Windows 7+ / Mac OS X 10.6.8+ (WindowsXP will work, but it just isn't cool anymore, y'know?)</li>
              <li>4GB of RAM (2GB will work, but your experience won't be silky smooth)</li>
              <li>Audio headset or microphone (because you are the type of person that wants to talk to your peers, right?)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The nitty gritty, or the what ifs?</h2>

            <h3>This sounds cool! Can I test it out before hand?</h3>

            <p>Of course! Although CANHEIT virtual world will only be available a few weeks before the conference, you can still <a href="http://avayalive.com/Engage/">read about the Avaya technology</a> or <a href="http://avayalive.com/Engage/Overview.aspx">test out one of their pre-configured virtual environments</a> for yourself today!</p>

            <h3>What if the tech doesn't work on my system?</h3>

            <p>Don't worry, prior to the conference we'll have a test for all attendees to make sure your tech works the way it should. We'll have helpers on hand that can work through some of the technical issues that may arise. We want you to enjoy your virtual experience!</p>

            <h3>Will there be a refund/transfer policy?</h3>

            <p>Here are the refund and transfer policies for Virtual attendance:</p>

            <p><strong>Virtual attendance refunds</strong>: We're all fans of new and cool technology but we understand that sometimes it doesn't always work as expected. If you've chosen the "Virtual Attendance" option, you'll be offered a trial period to test the technology, and we'll offer you a full refund until May 31, 2013 if you just can't get the virtual environment working on your system. No refunds will be issued for cancellations received after May 31, 2013 or for “No-Show” registrants.</p>

            <p><strong>Virtual attendance transfers</strong>: We know that you'd love to experience our 3D CANHEIT world, but if something comes up and you're unable to participate, you can transfer your virtual registration up until May 31, 2013.</p>

            To learn more, <a href="/register/#cancellation-or-transfer">see the full cancellation and transfer policies</a> on the registration page.

            <h3>What if I still have questions?</h3>

            <p>Send us an email at <a href="mailto:canheit@uottawa.ca">canheit@uottawa.ca</a> and we'll be happy to help!</p>
