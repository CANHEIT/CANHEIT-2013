    					<h2>We’re looking for remarkable and exciting!</h2>
    					<p><strong>Exceptional Ideas for a changing world.</strong> That's this year's conference theme; recognizing that there are some really exceptional solutions to the challenges of our constantly changing world. Have you been able to implement something innovative on your campus? Have you been able to overcome an insurmountable obstacle? Exceptional ideas can come from anywhere and from anyone, leading to awesome opportunities to inspire and to do things differently. It’s not breaking the rules, but proposals that embrace the conference theme will stick out from the crowd… in a very good way!</p>
    					 
    					<p>We're looking for YOUR topics. The program streams will emerge from your proposals, the crowdsourced ideas we collected from you in November, and from  your crowdvote (coming  in February). However, if you’re looking for some topic ideas, here are a few: Cyberinfrastructure, Academic analytics, Alternative sourcing, Shareable innovations, Challenges of  IT consumerization, the Post PC era, Disruptive technologies, DevOps, or use your experiences and imagination to propose something awesome!</p>
  					</div>
  					
  					<div id="guidelines">
  					  <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
  					  <p>Selecting the exceptional is no easy task, so we’re going to ask for your help! Proposal evaluations will be done in two parts: through crowdvoting by the CANHEIT community from Canadian higher-ed institutions and an evaluation committee process from February 1- 21, 2013. CANHEIT receives a lot of submissions, make sure we understand your vision by following these guidelines:</p>
  					  <ol>
                <li><strong>Embrace the theme</strong> “Exceptional ideas for a changing world”</li>
                <li>Simplify! Your abstract must be <strong>250 to 500 words</strong> long.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect with the audience.</strong> Proposals are from members of Canadian universities and colleges.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote information technology</strong> in higher education, particularly in Canada</li>
                <li><strong>Highlight</strong> relevant, topical or emerging technology or practices</li> 
                <li><strong>Refresh it</strong>: information shared at previous or similar venues, should demonstrate a significant update for the CANHEIT 2013 audience</li>
                <li><strong>Demonstrate attention to the topic</strong>, including an awareness of its larger context</li>
                <li><strong>Think about quality</strong> – clarity, readability, and sufficiency of information.</li>
                <li id="session-formats"><strong>Consider a different and exciting session format</strong> to engage and stimulate your audience
                    <aside role="note" class="note">
                      <h3>What are the session formats I can choose from?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>The traditional conference-style presentation continues to hold an important role in the program. But why not stimulate and engage the attention of delegates by adapting your presentation to a new format! </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Traditional presentation:</strong> Short prepared presentation intended to stimuate conversation. Encourage the audience to engage and seek further information.</li> 
                          <li><strong><span lang="fr">Présentation en français</span> :</strong> Traditional presentation with simultaneous translation. <span lang="fr">Ça vous tente de faire votre présentation en français? Vous pouvez le faire!</span></li>
                          <li><strong>Flip the session:</strong> Presenters share session content prior to the conference, and use the session time for conversations, debates, and brainstorming on the session topic. We assist you in coordinating with session participants.</li>
                          <li><strong>Point/counterpoint debate:</strong> Short debate on a hot and topical issue. Two debaters each present their perspectives on opposing sides of a question and the attendees deliberate on the  outcome.</li> 
                          <li><strong>Lightning round:</strong> 3 to 6 very short presentations by different speakers giving diverse viewpoints on one topic. Ideal for communities of practice and different organizations/areas within an organization with different approaches to the same issue.</li> 
                          <li><strong>Panel:</strong> A moderated session where 2 to 5 speakers present different opinions on how they are tackling an issue. Some examples: our best project of the year, the future of IT professionals in higher education, the one thing IT needs to change in the next 12 months, innovations in student labs, or suggest your own topic!</li>
                          <li><strong>Workshop/Lab session:</strong> A hands-on session led by an innovator about  a technique, knowledge, methodology, or application they have developed  and are sharing with the CANHEIT community. This format may require 2 -3 hours, depending on the content.</li>
                          <li><strong>Poster session:</strong> A visual feast to quickly and efficiently communicate your ideas or innovations to conference attendees in a casual and relaxed manner. Engage attendees in one-on-one discussions.</li>                    
                          <li><strong>Birds of a Feather (BoFs):</strong> Much more informal, attendees with common interests or issues gather in a flock to debate, discuss, and share information.</li>
                        </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Some proposals may be joined with similar proposals or included as part of a panel session, if appropriate.</li>
                <li>If your proposal is selected, you will need to register for the conference no later than May 1, 2013.</li>
